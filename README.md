# telegram_engprep_bot
Simple telegram bot to help you memorize words in English (for Hebrew speakers)

# Note:
This bot was developed for hebrew speakers but with some slight changes, you can change the bot to be a trainer for any other language. For example for Spanish speakers all you have to do is
1. to have a csv file with header id, word (english), translation(spanish) 
2. name this file "new_dict.csv" 
3. put it in the same diectory your bot is, where its main.py is 
4. get your bot token from BotFather (google how to do it or see https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token)
5. put the token as first row in file named "keys.txt" (Not the most secure but good enough for our purposes)
6. run the bot "python main.py" 
7. you are done! go to your bot and use it :)
